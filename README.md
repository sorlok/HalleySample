# HalleySample
Sample project with the Halley game engine

This is a sample project I'm working on with:
https://github.com/amzeratul/halley

You'll need to clone that project into the "Halley" folder (and then apply pull request #50 from that repo). 

Right now, the Spritesheet code seems... wrong? The width/height and position are all set correctly, but the sprite itself seems "zoomed" in too much.

I'd like to get back to experimenting with Entity Component System at some point, but right now I'm stumbling over pretty basic engine stuff, so I'm taking a break.
